            <h1>What is robotics?</h1>
            Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that combines engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and other scientific disciplines to create and study robots. The history of robotics dates back to ancient times, where various cultures and civilizations had mythical tales and automata that resembled human-like or animal-like forms. However, the modern development of robotics began in the 20th century and has since evolved significantly. 1920s-1930s: The term "robot" was introduced by Czech playwright Karel ÄŒapek in his play "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" in 1920. The play depicted artificial, human-like beings created through a biological process rather than electronic means. The word "robot" was derived from the Czech word "robota," which means forced labor.<br> <br>1940s-1950s: The development of electronic computers and digital technology in the mid-20th century led to significant advancements in robotics. Researchers and engineers started working on the concept of programmable machines capable of performing tasks autonomously.1990s-2000s: With advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies, robots became more sophisticated and capable of performing complex tasks. Robots were deployed in applications such as medical surgery, space exploration, and hazardous environment inspections. 2010s: Collaborative robots, or cobots, were introduced, designed to work alongside humans safely. These robots could assist with various tasks in manufacturing and assembly lines. make it simpler</div>
